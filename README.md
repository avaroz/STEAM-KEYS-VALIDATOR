# STEAM-KEYS-VALIDATOR (V1)

Validate multiple steam keys and generate txt files with the keys that have not been used and those that were used.

#### Personal note
* This project was created on a night of sleeplessness, has an unpredictable error of error and depends on the loading speed of the partner.steamgames.com page, the code is barely functional and maybe it was not written in the best way, but It fulfills its purpose.
* Only steam game developers should use this code, I do not recommend validating many keys at once and I am not responsible if you violate any valve norm, use it at your own risk.
* Validate the keys several times or manually to be sure.
* No, it has no virus, and I will not steal your keys, check the code is completely clean.
